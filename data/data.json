    "fullDescription": "React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is developed and maintained by Facebook, and is often used for building single-page applications and mobile applications.One reason to learn React is that it is a popular and in-demand technology, so learning it can improve your job prospects and make it easier to find work as a front-end developer. React is also a good choice for building modern web applications because it is efficient, scalable, and fast, and it uses a virtual DOM (a lightweight in-memory representation of the actual DOM) to minimize the number of DOM manipulations required, which makes it easier to build high-performance applications.Another reason to learn React is that it is a well-designed and flexible library that makes it easy to build reusable components that can be composed to build complex user interfaces. This makes it easier to maintain and update your codebase over time, as you can reuse components in multiple places rather than having to rewrite the same code multiple times.Overall, React is a powerful and widely used tool for building modern web applications, and learning it can be a valuable addition to your skillset as a front-end developer."

    "fullDescription": "I guess let's start by answering the most pressing question first. What is a serverless function and why should we care? So, here is the deal. There are times when our app needs a dynamic feature and even after that 20th google search, we inevitably come to realization that the only way do it, is by building and hosting our own server. A good example would be setting up a stripe payment flow. There is a better solution though.Serverless Functions.Ok, but what is a serverless function? Well, despite the name, serverless function actually does not mean that there is no server. What it simply means, is that someone else is responsible for maintaining it . We, as front-end developers only need to setup our desired functionality, and the cloud provider will take care of the rest. What also really cool, we can continue to use our favorite programming language â€“ Javascript. Most cloud providers offer some solution of serverless functions but for this course we will hosting company by the name of Netlify. We will use Netlify because they offer generous free tier and make it very easy,  to get up and running with serverless functions."

    "fullDescription": "I guess let's start by answering the most pressing question first. What is a NodeJS? And even though there are plenty of good answers out there the one that I like the most is this one - 'NodeJS is an environment to run Javascript outside of the Browser'. NodeJS was created in 2009 and it's built on top of Chrome's V8 Javascript Engine. As you are probably aware of, every browser has an engine, a tool that compiles our code down to machine code and Chrome uses one by the name of V8. Since the moment it was created, Node has evolved tremendously, and while there are many things to like about Node, some of the main ones are - large community, since that tremendously saves time on feature development, as well as the fact that with the help of Node, it's never been easier to build Full-Stack Apps, since both Front-End And Back-End are built in one language, and you guessed that language is our beloved Javascript."

No longer we need to create component decide on a selector and then rush to app css or any other stylesheet to write separate styles for that particular component. What makes Styled Components so cool is their awesome tagged template syntax that allows to create normal react components by only defining styles. With zero configuration styled-components support css modularity, variables in css, nesting in css, extending components styles and many more. Styled Components also allows us to  write plain CSS in your components without worrying about class name collisions"
